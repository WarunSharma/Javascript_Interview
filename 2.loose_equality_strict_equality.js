✔️ == (loose equality) compares values after type coercion.

✔️ === (strict equality) compares both value and type without coercion.

🧪 Example to Add:
js
Copy
Edit
0 == '0'      // true — types are coerced
0 === '0'     // false — number vs `   `` only common case where == is useful is null == undefined, which returns true."
