# Asynchronous JavaScript & The Event Loop

---

JavaScript runs in a single thread but uses the **event loop** to handle asynchronous tasks (like `setTimeout`, Promises, or `fetch` calls) efficiently.

When async code is executed (e.g., `setTimeout()` or `fetch()`), the actual operation (such as an HTTP request or timer) is handled by the browser/Web APIs.

Once the operation completes, a callback or continuation (like `.then()`) is queued:

- **Macrotask queue:**  
  - `setTimeout`
  - `setInterval`
  - `setImmediate`

- **Microtask queue:**  
  - `Promise.then()`
  - `async/await`
  - `queueMicrotask`

The event loop constantly checks if the call stack is empty. If it is, it:

1. Processes **all microtasks**,
2. Then takes **one macrotask** and processes it.

`async/await` is just syntactic sugar over Promises.  
It makes asynchronous code look and behave like synchronous code, improving readability and error handling using try/catch.
