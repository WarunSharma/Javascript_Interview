/*

A callback is a function passed into another function to execute later, usually after an async operation.
A Promise is an object that represents the result of an async operation. Unlike callbacks, Promises provide chaining, built-in error handling, and avoid issues like callback hell.
**pending**: Initial state

**fulfilled**: Operation completed successfully (✅ resolve called)

**rejected**: Operation failed (❌ reject called)
